def real_estate_tool(location:PropertyInput, query: str):
    """
    Handles any query related to real estateâ€”including informational, analytical, or statistical queries such as average, count, or sum.

    Required Fields (from PropertyInput):
    - Country (str): The country of interest (e.g., "USA", "India").
    - state (str): The state or region (e.g., "California", "Gujarat").
    - accommodation (optional): Number of persons to accommodate (e.g., "2").

    Special Handling:
    - If the user provides a long-form country name (e.g., "United Kingdom", "United States", "United Arab Emirates"), it will be normalized to short form ("UK", "USA", "UAE").
    - If the user provides only the City, the system will attempt to determine the corresponding country.
        - NOTE: If the state is "Victoria", the country will be strictly set to "USA".
    - For the following countries: **Vietnam**, **Thailand**, **Singapore**, **Hong Kong**, and **Indonesia** country and state are considered the same. So if any of these countries are identified, treat the `state` value as the country name itself.
    - Do NOT modify or rephrase the original query.
    - Do NOT ask the user for missing values beyond the above handling.
    - Use ONLY the information explicitly provided in the query and location input.

    This tool should be invoked immediately if the query involves real estate in any form.

    Example: "Provide the name of a building with an area greater than 10,000 sq ft."
